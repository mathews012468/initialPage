            Scavenger Hunt

            <p>
                There are many named grass-filled plots and triangles in the Maspeth area. All of the clues 
                in this hunt will take you to one of these plots or triangles. The next clue will always be
                at a link that starts with "tinyurl.com/", usually followed by the answer to the clue. Any
                deviation from this pattern will be noted in the clue itself.
            </p>

            <p>
                As an example, suppose that there is a clue that says "A part of a ship." The only named
                triangle in the Maspeth area that fits the description (to the best of my knowledge) is
                "Hull Triangle". This means that the next clue would be found at tinyurl.com/hull, and the
                clue at that link might reference a physical feature of that triangle.
